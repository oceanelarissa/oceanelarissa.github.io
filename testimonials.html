             <p id="review"><b>"</b>Marielle has been teaching my son Sriram for two year and have been preparing him for GCSEs this year. She has been an excellent teacher with great knowledge and skill in training for GCSE level. Sriram"s score has increased by 2 levels ever since and I am really pleased with the progress he has made. I would highly recommend Marielle for tutoring French. Sriram is now performing above his target level for French and his reading writing and listening skills are well above expectation.<b>"</b>

            <p id="review">We really appreciate Marielle’s professional input with our daughter over the past academic year. Marielle’s tutoring has given our daughter the confidence boost she required to tackle French GCSE and we are keen to continue tutoring through A Level French!

                    <h3> GCSE Review </h3>
               
        <p id="review"><b>"</b> We first met Marielle in 2011 when we were moving to Hong Kong and needed to give our children a boost before they started at the French International School. She was able to give them the confidence to settle in quickly and succeed academically in the French system. We continued to use Marielle when we got back to the UK. Whilst our children are bilingual, she was able to give them the tools to ensure that they can write the language as well as speak the language. She is extremely organised and her lessons are well structured with clear goals in mind. Her manner is calm and patient. My son took his GSCE a year early and achieved an A*. Marielle gave him a solid learning structure from the outset which enabled him to achieve his goal. He is now achieving top results. <b>"</b></p>

                    <h3> Adult French Review </h3>
                
        <p id="review">I learnt French with Marielle for just over 2 years. My A level French was incredibly rusty and Marielle met with me weekly to ensure I was confident with relevant vocabulary and phrases for a birthday trip to Paris. After this we met fortnightly in order for me to continue improving and because I enjoyed the lessons. Marielle always presented me with a variety of activities that were relevant to my ability. We read newspaper clips, watched videos, did listening activities, and she encouraged me to read French books that we then discussed, as well as writing about different subjects. Marielle made sure the lessons were relevant and tailored to my ability and we always had plenty of time to chat and improve my fluency. Marielle was skilled at picking up on my common mistakes without disrupting what I was trying to say. She would then use those mistakes to provide more relevant activities in the next session.
