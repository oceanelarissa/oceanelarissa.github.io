<p >Salut! Je m’appelle Marielle and I am a French native speaker and specialise in Online Language Tution. Being brought up in Burgandy, and attending University in Dijon, I got married and spent 25 years in the south of England. 
    During that time, I took an Adult teaching certificate and spent many years teaching in Adult Educations, Colleges, University, schools, Language Centres and also ran French after-school clubs. </p>
    
   <p> Back in Burgundy, I now offer online courses for all levels: preparation for official exams and more tailored French courses for children, adolescents, academics or entrepreneurs. 
    Having lived in England and worked in several state and private schools, I am extremly familiar with the various GCSCE, IGCSE and Alevel exam boards including: AQA, Edexcel and WJEC. 
    My goal is to help you speak French, be fluent and reduce your accent. I’ve also been an Examiner for the OCR exams and more recently A level French exams.
    
   According to your level and learning objectives, I will help you improve your listening, reading, speaking and writing skills, focusing on achieving your goals,
    whether that be getting an A* at GCSE, or preparing to move over to France for retirement .
 
    
    In addition to the learning done within the lesson, I provide a wealth of resources that enable you to keep learning in your spare time, 
    including: movies, podcasts, documents, exercises, newspaper articles and tv shows.   
    
    I am highly organised and ensure that each lesson is tailored to <i>your</i> needs.
    
    Don't hesitate contact me with any questions or to book a free 20 minute consultation. 

    In my spare time, I enjoy hiking, reading, gardening and love talking to people of other cultures!
